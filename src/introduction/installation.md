since this project is still a work in progress,
you have to build it from source.

***


the [shell.nix](https://github.com/vnuxa/astrum/blob/d270a71bd72846e0e01c6d0cab5afe685496e330/shell.nix) contains all of the dependencies needed

if you use nixos you can just run
```
nix-shell
cargo run
```


***
I also recommend having the [lua language server](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server) installed in your text editor, since it contains astrum types and descriptions
