astrum is a widgeting system that depends on [libcosmic](https://github.com/pop-os/libcosmic)
it can on any wayland compositor with the `layer-shell` protocol.


astrum is made in rust and is configured in lua
i reccomend using the [lua language server](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server) as that is what i will depend on for types
and i reccomend getting familiar with the annotation syntax as that is what i will show in documentation
