astrum is a widgeting system that depends on [libcosmic](https://github.com/pop-os/libcosmic)\
it can rim on any wayland compositor that supports the `layer-shell` protocol.
\
\
astrum is made in rust and is configured in lua\
i reccomend using the [lua language server](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server) as that is what i will depend on for types in lua
and i reccomend getting familiar with the annotation syntax as that is what i will show in documentation
